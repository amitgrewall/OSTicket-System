<h2>Languages and Utilities Used</h2>

- <b>PowerShell</b> 
- <b>Oracle VirtualBox</b>

<h2>Environments Used </h2>

- <b>XAMPP (Apache, MySQL, PHP)</b>
- <b> osTicket v1.18.2</b>
- <b> Windows 10 Pro</b>
<h2>Program walk-through:</h2>


This screenshot shows multiple support tickets submitted using the osTicket help desk system. Each ticket reflects a realistic workplace scenario and is routed to the appropriate department :  <br/>

This screenshot shows the detailed view of a submitted ticket. From here, I can read the user's issue, reply to them, assign the ticket to the right department or team member, and update its status as needed. It demonstrates my familiarity with handling and managing support tickets using osTicket, just like in a real help desk environment: <br/>

This screenshot also shows my response to the user's issue, demonstrating how I communicated with the user directly through the ticket system to help resolve their problem:  <br/>

This screenshot shows the final stage of the ticket resolution process. After verifying the issue was resolved with the user, I added internal documentation detailing the steps taken, updated the ticket status, and formally closed it. This follows industry best practices for help desk ticket lifecycle management, ensuring accurate records and accountability :  <br/>
